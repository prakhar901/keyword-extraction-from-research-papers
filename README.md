# keyword-extraction-from-research-papers
We have first done conversion of pdf to text and then extracted keywords from the document using some different algorithms namely RAKE YAKE TF-IDF and modified them in a way such that we get best extracted keywords which relates to the document and help us understanding the document.
In this research we have considered different models and their implementation to derive
differences among all the opinions of the individual based on the algorithms.We have first studied
conversion of pdf to text and then how to extract keywords from the document using some
different algorithms namely RAKE YAKE TF-IDF and modified them in a way such that we get
best extracted keywords which relates to the document and help us understanding the document.
At the end, we have compared different algorithms on the basis of the extracted keywords. It
further provided us with the judgment of identifying the most efficient algorithm among all.
Given the factual truth, we could guess which approach works best for the opinion of best
keywords.
We have used a guided approach in studying
and implementing the various models of
opinion. First we have taken the pdf file as a
input after that we have converted the pdf file
into the text and after conversion of text we
have done the data pre-processing in that we
have done the Tokenization , Removing of
stop-words and Relevant Data Extraction after
that we have implemented different types of
Keyword Extraction Algorithm i.e Rake, Yake,
Tf-Idf and modified them as per our need to get
best result .
Our approach involved a lot of research to fully
understand the given model and then
converting to code for the given model. On the
completion of the code, the results were
extracted.
